# Boston_Housing-model
Boston Housing Price Prediction
üìç Technologies: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Machine Learning

Developed a Machine Learning model using RandomForestRegressor to predict housing prices based on multiple real estate factors.
Performed Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values (SimpleImputer), applied Feature Scaling (StandardScaler), and ensured balanced data distribution using Stratified Sampling.
Model Optimization: Used Cross-Validation to validate model performance and fine-tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
Evaluation: Measured accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set for performance benchmarking.
Deployment-Ready: Saved the trained model using joblib for potential real-world applications.
